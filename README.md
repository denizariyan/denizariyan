### Hi there 

  I'm currently interested in Cybersecurity of IoT devices. Anything from hardware hacking to reverse engineering the software interests me right now. Altough I have many personal projects around this topic I really dont like writing long project reports therefore check my blog linked below where I might post some of my projects if I think it would benefit the community.

#### Some things I work on even though you might not find any public repos about them on my profile are:

- Rapid Prototyping
- 3D Design & Manufacturing
- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Embedded System Security
- Automation 
- IoT devices of all types
- Computer Vision
- Closed Loop Guidance
- Event Management
- Photography, mostly urban and street photography
